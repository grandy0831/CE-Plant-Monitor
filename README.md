# ðŸŒ³ Plant-Monitor

## Overview
>The project is a plant monitor designed to monitor the plant's environment such as soil moisture of plants, while using Feather Huzzah ESP8266 Wi-Fi connection and MQTT server to publish sensor data, and using RPi gateway to store and visualize time series data.

## Function
- Real-time monitoring of plant temperature and humidity and moisture.
- Collect data through sensors and send it to a cloud database.
- Data can be transmitted through MQTT protocol.
- Stores data on the RPi gateway.
- Visualize time series data.
