# üå≥ Plant-Monitor

## Overview
>The project is a plant monitor designed to monitor the plant's environment such as soil moisture of plants, while using Feather Huzzah ESP8266 Wi-Fi connection and MQTT server to publish sensor data, and using RPi gateway to store and visualize time series data.

## Function
- Real-time monitoring of plant temperature and humidity and moisture.
- Collect data through sensors and send it to a cloud database.
- Data can be transmitted through MQTT protocol.
- Stores data on the RPi gateway.
- Visualize time series data.

## Installation
### Materials required

### Setup Steps

#### 1. **Feather Set-up**

##### Add Feather Huzzah ESP8266 to the board manager of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

  1. Open the Arduino IDE.
  2. Go to "File" -> "Preferences".
  3. Add the following URL to the "additional development board manager URLs": 
  `https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`
  4. After confirmation, go to "Tools" -> "Development Board" -> "Development Board Manager".
  5. In the search box, enter `ESP8266`.
  6. Install `esp8266 by ESP8266 Community`.
  7. Select `Feather Huzzah ESP8266` board.

##### Upload code to Feather Huzzah ESP8266

  1. Connect the Feather Huzzah ESP8266 to your computer via USB.
  2. Select the correct port and development board.
  3. Open a sample code, such as "Blink".
  4. Click "Upload" to upload the code to Feather Huzzah ESP8266.

Once you can get the blink example working, jump to the next step.

#### 3. **Getting the time**

  In this step, you will learn to get time from the Internet, which is very important for subsequent data acquisition and recording.<br>

#### 5. **Moisture sensing**

  The sensor of the plant monitor is based on two parts - a DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor and a pair of nails. While the former exists in convenient, accurate, and packaged form, the latter requires a lot more creativity and tinkering to make it work. We'll start by creating a soil sensor.
<br> <br> 
  The basic principle is to measure the soil resistance between two nails that are separated by a distance. The higher the water content in the soil, the lower the electrical resistance. There are many challenges with nails, from electrolysis to determining the meaning of the simulated reading (It depends on nail length, soil depth, soil type, distance between nails, etc.).
<br> <br> 
The Fritzing diagram below shows the circuit for connecting a soil sensor using 2 nails and a DHT22 sensor.<img width="1076" alt="e38e251e2e837937" src="https://github.com/grandy0831/CE-Plant-Monitor/assets/140076679/28a1031e-ee9c-40a5-95b1-d36f85851975"><img width="1201" alt="14e0883730a7e435" src="https://github.com/grandy0831/CE-Plant-Monitor/assets/140076679/d1f01d2b-432b-4da2-b99b-bcc1dbd9dc49">![dfb2411573027bfe](https://github.com/grandy0831/CE-Plant-Monitor/assets/140076679/59cebb80-8e7a-4c2b-a6ed-c26a9797834f)<br>

#### 6. **Generate an HTML page**

A complete working example of the code  is [available here on GitHub](https://github.com/grandy0831/CE-Plant-Monitor/tree/main/Generate_an_HTML_page).<br><br>

You can also change the style to create the table yourself.<br><br>![Êà™Â±è2023-10-31 03 18 43](https://github.com/grandy0831/CE-Plant-Monitor/assets/140076679/d84293a6-5bc0-4d3b-9eb4-416884665958)

#### 7. **Sending Soil Data to MQTT**

A complete working example of the code  is [available here on GitHub](https://github.com/grandy0831/CE-Plant-Monitor/tree/main/Plant_Monitor).<br><br>
The data should now flow from the Huzzah plant monitor to the MQTT web server and be locally visible by browsing the device's IP address.<br><br>

#### 8. **Setting up a RPi as a gateway**

In this step, we configured the Raspberry PI as a data gateway to collect and process data from the plant monitor.<br><br>
[This page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) can help you set up your Raspberry PI.<br><br>

<img width="792" alt="7195b6768554ba3c" src="https://github.com/grandy0831/CE-Plant-Monitor/assets/140076679/9222f89c-151b-49be-bb6f-61326d923331"><br><br>
On your Mac / PC open up a Terminal / Putty session and log into the device using SSH.

    ssh USERNAME@YOURHOSTNAME.local

To check the OS of the device enter the following:

    cat /etc/os-release
Finally do a quick update / upgrade to make sure all files are upto date and then reboot before moving on to installing the datastore.

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo reboot
<br><br>

#### 9. **Installing InfluxDB on RPi**
InfluxDB downloads are [available here](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/#influxdb).We will use the Ubuntu & Debian (Arm 64-bit) option.
<br><br>
  1.Add the InfluxDB key to ensure secure download and the repository to the sources list so that we can download it in the next step.
  
    wget -q https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdata-archive_compat.key
    echo '393e8779c89ac8d958f81f942f9ad7fb82a25e133faddaf92e15b16e6ac9ce4c influxdata-archive_compat.key' | sha256sum -c && cat influxdata-archive_compat.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdata-archive_compat.gpg > /dev/null
    echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdata-archive_compat.gpg] https://repos.influxdata.com/debian stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdata.list
  2.With the repository added we now run another update to the package list
  
    sudo apt-get update
    
  3.Finally we install InfluxDB

    sudo apt-get install influxdb2 -y

  4.Finally to get InfluxDB up and running at reboot we need to enable and start it within systemctl

    sudo systemctl unmask influxdb.service
    sudo systemctl start influxdb
    sudo systemctl enable influxdb.service
    sudo systemctl status influxdb

  Use `CTRL C` to break out of the systemctl command and get back to the terminal prompt.<br><br>
